# Ensemble-Techniques
### Ensemble methods is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model

###### Types of Ensemble Methods
### BAGGing or Bootstrap AGGregating-
BAGGing gets its name because it combines Bootstrapping and Aggregation to form one ensemble model. Given a sample of data, multiple bootstrapped subsamples are pulled. A Decision Tree is formed on each of the bootstrapped subsamples. After each subsample Decision Tree has been formed, an algorithm is used to aggregate over the Decision Trees to form the most efficient predictor.
